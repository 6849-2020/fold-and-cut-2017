This is a CoffeeScript implementation of the [straight-skeleton method for the
fold-and-cut problem](http://erikdemaine.org/foldcut/#skeleton),
written by Danielle Wang as a final project for
[6.849: Geometric Folding Algorithms](http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.849/)
in [Spring 2017](http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.849/spring17/).
